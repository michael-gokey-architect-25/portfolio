Adobe and Me

I have a long history with Adobe products, and I will try to chronicle them here, over time. 
I had never thought of how much they have influenced my life over the past many years.
Aldus PageMaker was released in 1985, and I began learning on a Macintosh by 1988. 
Over the years, I have added other products to my skill set as Adobe has grown.
