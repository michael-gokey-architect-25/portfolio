You've indicated you have experience with **all 9 topics** over the past 2 years.
I'll analyze these topics through the lens of **what you need to master for conference presentations** versus **what audiences want to learn**.

## Deep-Dive Analysis

### Tier 1 - Master These First (High Demand + Broad Appeal)

**1. Novel applications of AI in games**
*Audience hunger: ★★★★★ | Your prep needs: High*
This is THE hottest topic right now. Audiences want concrete examples of LLMs for dialogue, generative AI for assets, and AI-driven narrative systems. You'll need real case studies, demos, and honest discussions about what works vs. hype.

**2. Machine learning for game development**
*Audience hunger: ★★★★★ | Your prep needs: Medium-High*
Studios desperately want practical knowledge about integrating ML into their pipelines—animation blending, playtesting automation, content validation. You need hands-on examples of tools, workflows, and ROI stories that prove value to skeptical teams.

**3. In-Game AI as NPC, Final Boss, Game Master**
*Audience hunger: ★★★★★ | Your prep needs: Medium*
Everyone wants smarter NPCs that feel alive, especially post-ChatGPT. You'll need to demonstrate working implementations, discuss latency/cost challenges, and show the difference between scripted intelligence and true adaptability.

### Tier 2 - Strong Differentiators (Good Demand + Less Competition)

**4. Adaptive gameplay and accessibility**
*Audience hunger: ★★★★☆ | Your prep needs: Medium*
Growing priority as accessibility becomes standard practice and players expect personalization. You need real examples of difficulty scaling, input adaptation, and how AI can make games more inclusive without compromising design intent.

**5. Reinforcement learning and emergent play**
*Audience hunger: ★★★★☆ | Your prep needs: High*
Fascinating but technical—audiences want to see RL creating surprising behaviors and self-balancing systems. You'll need to translate the math into game design benefits and show actual emergent gameplay moments, not just training graphs.

**6. Runtime AI in social and multiplayer games**
*Audience hunger: ★★★★☆ | Your prep needs: Medium-High*
Critical for live games but complex territory covering moderation, dynamic events, and player matching. You need expertise in real-time constraints, ethical considerations, and how to deploy AI that enhances rather than disrupts community dynamics.

### Tier 3 - Solid Foundation Topics (Steady Interest)

**7. Procedural generation and simulation**
*Audience hunger: ★★★☆☆ | Your prep needs: Low-Medium*
Well-trodden ground but always relevant for roguelikes and world-building. Focus on what's NEW—using ML for PCG, quality control, or hybrid designer-AI workflows rather than rehashing basic noise functions.

**8. Data, analytics, and player research**
*Audience hunger: ★★★☆☆ | Your prep needs: Medium*
Essential but specialized—business and LiveOps folks care deeply while designers may tune out. You need compelling stories about how data changed design decisions and practical frameworks for small teams without data science departments.

**9. AI in education and training**
*Audience hunger: ★★☆☆☆ | Your prep needs: Low*
Niche audience interested in serious games and simulation. You can differentiate here with less competition, but expect smaller crowds unless you bridge to mainstream game development lessons about adaptive tutoring or skill assessment.

## Your Action Plan

**Immediate focus:** Master topics 1-3 deeply—these will fill conference rooms and establish your authority.

**Next level:** Develop strong 2-3 case studies each for topics 4-6 to differentiate yourself from generalist speakers.

**Background knowledge:** Keep topics 7-9 in your toolkit for panel discussions or specialized tracks, but don't prioritize unless they align with your unique experience.

**Pro tip:** The best talks combine multiple topics—like "Using RL to create adaptive NPCs" (topics 1, 3, 5) or "ML pipelines for accessible procedural content" (topics 2, 4, 7). Look for these intersections in your experience.

TAIG 2026: Transformer: AI and Games 2026

KSU Center,  Kennesaw, GA, United States, February 21-22, 2026

Perspectives on AI and Play: When Research and Practice Meet

The Center for Interactive Media at Kennesaw State University and the Georgia Game Developers Association invite submissions to the second edition of Transformer: AI and Games, a forum dedicated to exploring the intersections of artificial intelligence, game design, and interactive media.

This year’s theme, Perspectives on AI and Play: When Research and Practice Meet, highlights how AI technologies are transforming the way we design, study, and experience games. We welcome contributions from scholars, developers, educators, and students that advance research, practice, and innovation in AI and games.

The two-day event will feature panel discussions with academic and industry experts on the future of AI in games, alongside interactive demos of projects and prototypes on February 21. On February 22, participants will engage in hands-on workshops led by professionals and educators.

## Submission Categories

**Presentation Submissions**: Submit a 250–500 word abstract outlining the project, research, or practice-based work. Individual or co-authored presentations are welcome. Works-in-progress and emerging research are encouraged.

**Workshop Submissions**: Submit a 500-word abstract describing the workshop’s motivation and goals, the intended themes or skills addressed, the structure of activities, and any technical or material needs. Workshops may include design activities, game jams, prototyping, or tool demonstrations.

**Poster Submissions**: Submit a 250–300 word abstract summarizing research-in-progress, preliminary results, or innovative ideas suited for visual presentation. Posters should highlight key arguments, findings, or designs in a concise format that facilitates discussion. Accepted posters will be displayed throughout the conference, and at least one author must be present during the designated poster session.

**Demo Submissions**: Demonstration stations are available for standalone presentations or to augment any of the submission categories above. Hands-on experiences are especially encouraged. Submit a 250-word abstract describing the demo, whether a game, prototype, tool, or interactive narrative. If possible, include a link to a short video (up to three minutes) that showcases the work.

Accepted papers will be presented at the conference and included in the conference proceedings.
