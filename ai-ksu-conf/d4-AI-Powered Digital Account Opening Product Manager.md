## Phase 3: "Selling" to Different Audiences

### **To Executive Leadership (C-Suite)**

**Meeting:** 30-minute executive briefing

**Narrative:**
"We're losing customers and money. Our current account opening takes 3 days and has a 30% abandonment rate. We're also losing $2M annually to fraud. Meanwhile, Competitor X offers instant account opening. 

I'm proposing we build an AI-powered digital account opening system that solves both problems. Customers get approved in 10 minutes, and our fraud detection improves by 40%. The investment is $1M upfront, and we'll see $5M in annual benefits—faster payback than our other digital initiatives.

This also positions us for the future. The AI foundation we build here extends to other products. We'll capture the millennial/Gen-Z segment that expects digital-first experiences."

**Focus on:**
- Strategic imperative (competitive pressure, customer expectations)
- Financial returns (ROI, revenue impact, cost savings)
- Risk mitigation (fraud reduction, compliance)
- Speed to market
- Alignment with digital transformation goals

**What they'll ask:**
- "What's the ROI?" → Show the financial model
- "What if it doesn't work?" → Phased rollout with kill criteria
- "Why not buy instead of build?" → Competitive analysis showing gaps in vendor solutions
- "How long until we see results?" → Quick wins in Q1, full benefits by Q3

**Leave-behind:** 2-page executive summary with business case highlights

### **To IT Leadership / CTO**

**Meeting:** 1-hour technical deep-dive

**Narrative:**
"This isn't just a front-end project—it's a strategic platform play. We're building AI capabilities that become reusable assets across the bank. The fraud detection models we build here can extend to transaction monitoring. The document verification can be used in loan applications.

From an architecture standpoint, we're proposing a microservices approach with cloud-native deployment. This integrates with our existing core banking system via APIs, so we're not ripping and replacing. We want to partner closely with your team on the technical architecture."

**Focus on:**
- Technical feasibility and architecture
- Integration complexity and risks
- Security and compliance requirements
- Scalability and performance
- Resource needs (dev team, infrastructure)
- Tech debt considerations
- Reusability and platform thinking

**What they'll ask:**
- "How does this integrate with our core system?" → API integration strategy
- "What about data privacy and security?" → Encryption, access controls, compliance framework
- "Do we have the ML expertise?" → Hybrid approach: partner with AI vendor for models, own the orchestration
- "What's the maintenance burden?" → Ongoing costs, model retraining needs, monitoring requirements
- "Cloud or on-prem?" → Cloud recommendation with justification (scalability, AI tools)

**Co-creation approach:** 
"I need your team to validate the technical architecture. Let's schedule working sessions with your architects to pressure-test this design."

**Leave-behind:** Technical architecture diagram and integration specification

### **To Product Owner (and Dev Team)**

**Meeting:** Roadmap planning session (ongoing collaboration)

**Narrative:**
"You're going to own the execution of this vision. Here's what we're trying to achieve and why it matters to customers and the business. I'll provide the strategic direction, user research, and priorities. You'll break this down into actionable sprints and work with the team to ship it.

Let's walk through the PRD together. I want your input on feasibility, and I need you to flag any gaps or questions early."

**Focus on:**
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Dependencies and sequencing
- Technical constraints and trade-offs
- Definition of done
- Sprint planning and capacity
- Feedback loops and iteration plan

**What they'll ask:**
- "What's the priority order?" → Roadmap with clear sequencing and rationale
- "What's the MVP?" → Phase 1 scope with must-haves vs nice-to-haves
- "How do we handle unknowns?" → Spikes for AI model evaluation, proof of concepts
- "What about edge cases?" → Clear guidance on error handling, manual review triggers
- "How do we measure success?" → Metrics definition and tracking plan

**Collaborative approach:**
"I'll be in standups weekly, and I'm available anytime for questions. Let's do backlog refinement every two weeks. I'll bring user feedback and data insights; you bring technical realities. We'll figure out the best path forward together."

**Ongoing artifacts:**
- Refined backlog with prioritized user stories
- Sprint goals and success criteria
- User research findings and customer feedback
- Analytics reports showing feature performance

## Phase 4: PM as Charter Sponsor?

### **Short Answer: No, but closely related**

**Project Charter Sponsor** (in traditional project management):
- Usually a senior executive who provides funding and political support
- Owns business accountability for project success
- Removes organizational roadblocks
- Signs off on major decisions and scope changes
- **Example:** VP of Retail Banking or Chief Digital Officer

**Product Manager**:
- Owns product vision and execution
- Day-to-day decision maker
- Works for/with the Charter Sponsor
- Accountable for delivery and outcomes

### **The Relationship:**

```
Executive Sponsor (VP/C-Level)
    ├─ Provides budget and strategic alignment
    ├─ Removes organizational barriers
    └─ Approves major scope/timeline changes
           ↓
Product Manager (You)
    ├─ Owns product vision and roadmap
    ├─ Day-to-day prioritization and trade-offs
    ├─ Works with PO and dev teams
    └─ Reports progress to sponsor
           ↓
Product Owner
    ├─ Translates vision into backlog
    ├─ Works with dev team daily
    └─ Delivers working software
```

### **In Practice:**

**The PM would:**
- Create the business case that the executive sponsor approves
- Present to the steering committee (with the sponsor's backing)
- Report project health to the sponsor regularly
- Escalate risks and blockers to the sponsor
- Recommend go/no-go decisions for the sponsor to approve

**The Executive Sponsor would:**
- Champion the project at leadership level
- Allocate budget and resources
- Resolve cross-functional conflicts (IT vs Operations)
- Make final calls on major pivots
- Take ultimate accountability to the board/CEO
