Great thinking! Let's create a multi-level diagram structure that goes from high-level phases down to granular workflows. I'll describe the diagrams in a way you can easily map.

## Recommended Diagram Tools & Formats

For creating these diagrams:

1. **Level 1 (Swimlane)**: Lucidchart, Miro, Microsoft Visio, or draw.io
2. **Level 2 (BPMN)**: Lucidchart, Bizagi, Camunda Modeler
3. **Level 3 (Architecture)**: draw.io, Lucidchart, PlantUML, Mermaid
4. **Level 4 (User Flows)**: Figma, Miro, Whimsical, Lucidchart
5. **Level 5 (Sprint)**: Jira, Trello, Miro, Monday.com

---

## Next Steps: Drilling Down Further

You mentioned wanting to "break down each of those little sections even further." Here's how you could go even more granular:

### For Each Sprint, Create:
1. **Story Map** - Visual breakdown of user journey with stories underneath
2. **Task Breakdown** - Each story decomposed into technical tasks
3. **Data Flow Diagrams** - How data moves through the system
4. **Sequence Diagrams** - Interaction between components for each feature
5. **State Diagrams** - Status transitions (application states, fraud review states)

### For Architecture, Create:
1. **Deployment Diagram** - Infrastructure and hosting
2. **Network Diagram** - Security zones, firewalls, data flows
3. **Database Schema** - ER diagrams for each database
4. **API Specifications** - Endpoint definitions, request/response formats
5. **Security Architecture** - Authentication, authorization, encryption flows

Would you like me to drill down into any specific section? For example:
- Detailed sprint 1 breakdown (building the application form)?
- Complete fraud detection API sequence diagram?
- Database schema for application data?
- Detailed chatbot conversation flow with all decision branches?

Let me know which area you want to map out next, and we can get very granular!
