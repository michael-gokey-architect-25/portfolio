### **Option C: Hybrid Approach (My Recommendation)**

**GitHub Repo** (technical details, diagrams, documentation)  
↓  
**Links to →**  
↓  
**Medium/LinkedIn Article** (narrative, high-level overview)  
**+**  
**Figma File** (user flows, mockups - read-only link)

**Why this works:**
- Different audiences access different formats
- Shows versatility
- Maximum visibility (GitHub for devs, Medium for broader audience)
- Demonstrates full skillset

---

## Part 3: Making Your Diagrams Shine

### **Tips for Professional Diagrams**

**Consistency:**
- Use the same color scheme across all diagrams
- Consistent shape language (rectangles for processes, diamonds for decisions)
- Same font and sizing

**Recommended Color Palette:**
```
Primary: #2563EB (Blue - for main flows)
Secondary: #10B981 (Green - for success states)
Warning: #F59E0B (Orange - for decisions/caution)
Danger: #EF4444 (Red - for errors/risks)
Neutral: #64748B (Gray - for supporting elements)
```

**Clarity:**
- Don't overcrowd diagrams
- Use white space
- Label everything clearly
- Include a legend if using symbols

**Context:**
- Add a title and date to each diagram
- Include a brief description
- Show the "level" of detail (high-level vs granular)

## Part 4: Presenting in Interviews

### **How to Walk Through Your Case Study**

**1. Start with Impact (30 seconds)**
"I led the product strategy for a digital account opening system that reduced fraud by 40% and increased conversion by 25%, generating $5M in annual value."

**2. Show Your Process (2-3 minutes)**
Walk through your phase diagram, highlighting:
- How you discovered the opportunity (research)
- How you built consensus (business case)
- How you executed (roadmap)
- How you measured success (metrics)

**3. Go Deep on Request**
Have detailed diagrams ready for:
- "Tell me about your stakeholder management" → Show swimlane diagram
- "How did you prioritize features?" → Show roadmap and decision framework
- "Walk me through the technical architecture" → Show system diagram
- "How did you work with engineering?" → Show sprint workflow

**4. Show Artifacts**
Be ready to share:
- Sample PRD (sanitized)
- Business case template
- Roadmap
- Metrics dashboard

### **Presentation Format**

**For Virtual Interviews:**
- Screen share from your GitHub repo or portfolio site
- Have diagrams already open in tabs
- Use zoom/annotations to highlight key points

**For In-Person Interviews:**
- Bring laptop to show interactive version
- Have printed one-pager summary
- Offer to email full case study after

## Sample Mermaid Diagrams to Get You Started

I can create these in an artifact for you. Would you like me to create:

1. **Phase Timeline Diagram** - Mermaid gantt chart showing all 13 months
2. **User Flow Diagram** - Customer journey through account opening
3. **System Architecture** - High-level component diagram
4. **Sprint Workflow** - Agile process flow

Which one would be most helpful to start with?

## Final Recommendation

**For Maximum Impact:**

1. **Create GitHub repo** with all technical details (primary source of truth)
2. **Write Medium article** that tells the story and links to GitHub
3. **Add to LinkedIn** featured section and portfolio
4. **Create Figma prototype** of user flows (even basic wireframes)

**This gives you:**
- Technical credibility (GitHub)
- Storytelling ability (Medium)
- Professional visibility (LinkedIn)
- Design thinking (Figma)
