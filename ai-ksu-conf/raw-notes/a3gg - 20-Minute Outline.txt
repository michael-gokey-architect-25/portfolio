
To hit a **20-minute** presentation slot with a comfortable, professional cadence (accounting for slides, pauses, and audience reaction), we are looking at:

* **Total Page Count:** **6 to 7 pages** (Single-spaced, 1" margins, 12pt font).
* **Total Word Count:** **~2,500 – 2,800 words.**

If you use a "Speech Format" (14pt font, double-spaced to make it readable at a podium), that expands to about **10–12 pages**, but the word count remains the same.

### The 20-Minute "Dopamine to Data" Outline

Here is how to distribute those 7 pages across your presentation to ensure you don’t rush the technical "meat" or drag the intro.

#### I. The Hook: Engagement Theater vs. Reality (1.5 Pages / 4 Mins)

* **The Problem:** Why "Points for the sake of Points" fails.
* **The Thesis:** Gamification isn't UI decoration; it’s a **Behavioral Data Sensor**.
* **The Vision:** Turning dopamine (user joy) into high-fidelity data (business value).

#### II. The Framework: The 7 Sensors (1 Page / 3 Mins)

* **The Core Loop:** Defining **Quests** as the primary action.
* **The Feedback:** How **Badges** (milestones) and **Leaderboards** (social proof) wrap around the quest.
* **The Gamer’s Perspective:** Why this loop is inherently "fun" and avoids the "surveillance" feel.

#### III. The Architecture: Deep Dive (2.5 Pages / 7 Mins)

* **The Pipeline:** From "Quest Start" event to S3 optimized writes.
* **Infrastructure-as-Code:** How you scaled for 1,700 Duke Freshmen using AWS/Terraform.
* **The Identity Model:** Handling multi-tenant personas (Professional vs. Human) without losing the AI's "thread."
* **The "Inference Gap":** Real-time feedback (Badges) vs. Batch processing (AI Insights).

#### IV. Case Studies: Proof of Life (1 Page / 4 Mins)

* **The Duke Orientation:** Scaling to 1,700 users simultaneously.
* **Dragon Con / NY Auto Show:** Navigating physical spaces using digital nudges.
* **Health & Wellness:** Transitioning from "Convention Quests" to "Healthy Habit Quests."

#### V. The Closing: The Value Flywheel (0.5-1 Page / 2 Mins)

* **The Payoff:** How the data pays the bills (Personalization, Prediction, Profit).
* **Summary:** Gamification as a sophisticated behavioral system.
* **Final Thought:** The future of AI-driven incentive design.

### Technical Constraints for your Script

* **Slide Count:** Aim for **15–20 slides**. If you have more than one slide per minute, you’ll spend more time clicking than talking.
* **The "Slide Tax":** For every complex architecture diagram you show, subtract **50 words** from that page. You need the "silence" to let the audience look at the diagram.
