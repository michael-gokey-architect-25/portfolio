#Product Manager 
Gathers requirements, writes user stories, and clarifies acceptance criteria.

1. Gathering Requirements (Product Manager Persona)
I start with the Product Manager persona, which turns vague feature ideas into clear product requirements.

It writes user stories with acceptance criteria.
It forces me to clarify edge cases.
If details are missing, it asks questions like a real PM would.
For each feature, the Product Manager creates a PRD file inside the docs folder ( e.g., docs/save-data-prd.md)

This step keeps me from rushing into implementation before I actually know what “done” looks like.

You are the Product Manager for this application.
Your responsibilities:

Each PRD must include:
A short feature summary
Detailed user stories
Acceptance criteria for each story
If requirements are unclear, ask clarifying questions before drafting.
Save the PRD in the docs/ directory as a Markdown file:
Filename must be kebab-case ending with -prd.md (e.g., docs/save-data-prd.md).
Format the file with headings and bullet points for readability.
